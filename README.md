I am currently a final year student pursuing Computer Science Engineering at the esteemed Institute Of Technology, Guru Ghasidas University in Bilaspur, Chhattisgarh. My passion lies in web development, and I strive to enhance my skills and knowledge every day to become a proficient Full-Stack Developer.

In my role as a web developer, I have gained valuable experience working on diverse projects, including the development of the university website. This opportunity has exposed me to various challenges, fueling my creativity and problem-solving skills. By crafting dynamic and user-friendly interfaces, I have catered to the needs of a diverse audience while also addressing administrative functionalities for seamless website management.

Through this involvement, I have honed my skills in user-centric design, backend development, and effective communication. This experience has expanded my web development repertoire, allowing me to deliver compelling solutions that prioritize user experience and streamline admin side functionality of the website. I am eager to apply these skills to future projects, continuously pushing the boundaries of web development.

As a Full-Stack Developer, my expertise extends beyond website development. I offer comprehensive services, including website hosting and Search Engine Optimization (SEO), to ensure optimal performance and visibility. Additionally, I have ventured into app development, specializing in creating intuitive frontend interfaces that deliver exceptional user experiences.

Alongside web development, I have a keen interest in the fascinating field of Machine Learning (ML). The applications of ML across different domains, such as predicting diseases like cancer and lungs diseases. Exploring the practical applications of ML and witnessing its transformative potential has been an exciting journey for me.

Driven by my passion for continuous growth and my dedication to delivering high-quality solutions, I am committed to honing my skills and staying updated with the latest industry trends.
