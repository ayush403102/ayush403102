React Developer

In my role as a web developer, I have gained valuable experience working on diverse projects, including the development of the university website. This opportunity has exposed me to various challenges, fueling my creativity and problem-solving skills. By crafting dynamic and user-friendly interfaces, I have catered to the needs of a diverse audience while also addressing administrative functionalities for seamless website management.

Through this involvement, I have honed my skills in user-centric design, backend integration, and effective communication. This experience has expanded my web development repertoire, allowing me to deliver compelling solutions that prioritize user experience and streamline admin side functionality of the website. I am eager to apply these skills to future projects, continuously pushing the boundaries of web development.
